# ELoRa: LoRaWAN emulator for ChirpStack network server #

This is a traffic emulator for the [Chirpstack server stack](https://www.chirpstack.io/ "ChirpStack, open-source LoRaWANÂ® Network Server"). 

The code is a direct extension of the ns-3 [LoRaWAN module](https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan "LoRaWAN ns-3 module").

This module can be used to simulate in real-time multiple devices and gateways sharing a radio channel with very high flexibility in terms of possible configurations. LoRaWAN traffic is then UDP-encapsulated by gateways and forwarded outside the simulation. If a Chirpstack network server is in place, it will think the traffic is coming from a real network. All Class A MAC primitives used in the UE868 region are supported: radio transmission parameters of simulated devices can be changed by the downlink LoRaWAN traffic of the real server. 

In addition to what is provided by the original LoRaWAN module, the following changes/additions were made:

* A gateway application implementing the [UDP forwarder protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT "Semtech packet forwarder implementation") running on real gateways
* An helper to register devices and gateways in the server using the included [REST API](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-rest-api "ChirpStack gRPC to REST API proxy")
* Cryptographyc libraries to compute the Meassage Integrity Code (MIC) and encryption of packets for devices to be recognised by the server
* The `chirpstack-example` to show a complete usage of the traffic generator
* Many improvements and corrections of features of the original module, such that traffic could be transparently be accepted by the server

## Prerequisites ##

To use this simulator you need to know the following:

* The ChirpStack server needs to be running somewhere (reachable by the simulation via network)
* The registration helper (`chirpstack-helper` class) uses the cURL library to speak to the server. [Ns-3](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev "The Network Simulator, Version 3") does not support cURL by default so a minor modification is needed in the ns-3 CMake code. This change has been made in [this fork of the ns-3 repository](https://gitlab.com/non-det-alle/ns-3-dev "Ns-3 fork supporting cURL"), that has been used to test the emulator. Use the forked version which is maintaned by us, or reproduce the simple changes in your ns-3 version
* The simulator works as is with the default configuration of Chirpstark v4 on `localhost:8080`. It has been tested with the [docker-compose installation](https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/getting-started/docker.html "Chirpstack docs: Quickstart Docker Compose") of the server. To test a distributed version of the setup, the server/port address needs to be changed in `chirpstack-example`, and ChirpStack needs to be set up such that a Gateway Bridge container remains co-located on the same machine of the ELoRa process
* An authentification token needs to be generated in the server (API keys section), and needs to be copy-pasted in the constructor of `chirpstack-helper` class
* Ns-3 needs to be pre-configured with the `--enable-sudo` option

## Usage ##
For detailed information on how to run ELoRa refer to the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) file.

For more information on how to use the underlying LoRaWAN module refer to the [original module readme](https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan/blob/e8f7a21044418e92759d5c7c4bcab147cdaf05b3/README.md "LoRaWAN ns-3 module README").
